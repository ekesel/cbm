Minimal MVP to get a working pilot (suggested order)

A-01, A-02 (repo + dev compose)

B-01, B-02, B-03 (Django + users + models)

ETL: ETL-J1 (Jira connector), C-02 (Raw storage), C-03 (Normalizer for Jira)

C-04 (Validator) + C-05 (Remediation notifications)

E-01 (Metric snapshotter) + E-02 (basic queries)

F-01, F-02, F-03 (APIs)

G-01, G-02, G-03 (React skeleton + Team dashboard + WorkItem page)

D-01 (Jira automation rules) + L-01 (Jira automations doc)

I-01, I-02 (tests), J-01 (CI)
That set should enable an internal pilot for one Jira board in ~4–6 weeks (matches earlier estimate).

Example: How to ask me for code

To generate the Jira connector: Generate: ETL-J1

To get the Django WorkItem model: Generate: B-03

To get the Team Dashboard React page: Generate: G-02

To get the Jira automation JSON rules: Generate: D-01

(You can also ask multiple at once: Generate: B-03, ETL-J1 and I will produce both sequentially.)
